> [!IMPORTANT]
> This "RxJS with TypeScript" project ([Github](https://github.com/shuji-bonji/RxJS-with-TypeScript)) is created through collaboration between human engineers ([@shuji-bonji](https://github.com/shuji-bonji)) and generative AI ([ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/)).
> This project aims to be a model case of "co-created educational materials by humans and AI."

> [!NOTE]
> - [RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript)](https://rxjs.dev) is a library that supports asynchronous programming and event-based programming.
> - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is a strongly typed programming language based on JavaScript.
> - This English version was translated from Japanese using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and [DeepL MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/deepl).
