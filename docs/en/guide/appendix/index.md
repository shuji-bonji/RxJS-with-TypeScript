# Appendix

This section describes practical RxJS applications and how to use RxJS in specific fields.

The goal is to provide more specialized topics and practical applications not covered in the main guide to further deepen understanding of RxJS.

## Appendix Contents

| Topic | Overview | Target Audience |
|---------|------|---------|
| [Embedded Development and Reactive Programming](/en/guide/appendix/embedded-reactive-programming) | RxJS utilization in embedded systems, sensor integration, event correlation detection | Embedded developers, IoT engineers |
| [Reactive Approaches Beyond ReactiveX](/en/guide/appendix/reactive-patterns-beyond-rxjs) | Seven approaches including event-driven, state machines, and dataflow programming | Control engineering engineers, embedded developers |
| [Comprehensive Reactive Architecture Map](/en/guide/appendix/reactive-architecture-map) | 7-layer structure of UI, communication, backend, data pipeline, IoT, control, and UX | Full-stack engineers, architects |
| [Reactive Programming Reconsidered](/en/guide/appendix/reactive-programming-reconsidered) | Gap between RP ideals and reality, strengths and limitations, how to identify application areas | All developers, architects |
| [RxJS and Reactive Streams Ecosystem](/en/guide/appendix/rxjs-and-reactive-streams-ecosystem) | Overall technology stack including RxJS, Reactor, Kafka, and UI to data layer integration | Full-stack engineers, backend engineers |

## Planned Additions

The appendix section will continue to be expanded in the future. The following topics are under consideration.

- Practical patterns for WebSocket integration
- RxJS utilization in PWA
- Integration with Web Components
- RxJS on the server side (Node.js)
- Real-time data processing patterns
